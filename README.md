# Operating system

Create Ubuntu virtual machine as my host is a Windows 10 machine.  
Install Python and Pipenv on the linux vm for Python project configuration management.  
Install Firefox, Chrome and MSEdge.  

NOTE: Had significant problems with Firefox not running from pytest.
I thought it was me doing something wrong with the Pytest configuration, but after a lot of wasted time it turns out
that it's an Ubuntu 24.04 OS problem with the pytest/selenium webdriver not being able to invoke the "geckodriver" so,
for the moment, I have ignored Firefox and am using Chrome and Edge browsers.
I might be able to get Firefox working when I containerise all of this.

## Python Environment requires:

Python 3.12
Pipenv
After a little faffing around it seems you need to install pipenv in a container using the --system param:
pipenv install --system otherwise you have to create a user and setup the virtualenv in that which is counterproductive
since a container is (usually) a one user, one time thing anyway.
